        <p><b>To My Dearest Gauri,</b><span id="beloved"></span></p>
        <p>It is really very hard to express, but when you pinch yourself to find whether it is true.... Surprisingly it is! This may tend to sound a tad dramatic and startling, but trust me it is not even close to the real you. You are like a dream to me
            and I mean it totally. I had never even thought that someone so special could step in my dreary life and <b>Stay</b>!<br><br> <b>Happiest Anniversary Babyyy!!!</b><br><br>You are the strongest soul I have ever come across. You know how to
            collect yourself, you know how to be there in the gravest of situations. You do feel hurt, you do feel broke but your strength allows you to push through. It is like an inspiration to see someone push through adversities so profoundly. From
            strength I do not deny the fact of you being emotional and feeling low at times. It is okay to feel down on feelings, to let it out through tears, that does not reduce any points of you being strong. Strong enough to carry yourself, strong
            enough to handle uncanny situations, strong enough to make good decisions, strong enough to support your loved ones, and most importantly strong enough to stay patiently despite knowing the utter distress and hardship that lay.<br><br>You
            are an extremely loving and caring person. Once a person is close to you, you do care about them. It is such a beautiful gift you are endorsed with. It is just the most joyous feeling to be by your side! I seriously feel blessed to have someone
            like you with me. Even when I am unable to call you, I feel your presence right here, close to me and that makes me feel stronger to face and win over all the odds. Your voice itself is so comforting that listening to it makes me not just
            delighted but also relaxed from all the persisting tension and pressure!<br><br>Your smile is like the most mesmerizing thing, I see you smile and I feel calm and peace. It is one of the most beautiful sight my eyes can ever see. Truly I can
            never take my eyes off your lips. The look in your eyes is both penetrative and comforting. It is like a web where you get stuck when you look into it. It is deep and speaks a lot even when you are quiet. You are an epitome of beauty right
            from your hair, to your face, to your arms, to your waist, to your legs, to every part of you. I wish I was infested with the power to truly bestow love to every segment of you to its righteous amount. I can never see anything ever more alluring
            or soothing than you. I honestly worship every bit of you shona!<br> I cannot bring down in words how you make me feel every single day and how I see us growing together, closer and closer to each other.<br><br>As I always have told you, I
            could never have imagined you coming into my life. I always knew since the first day we started talking that you are different, unique and that I had never seen a girl as pure as you. I felt the connection, I felt the thrill, I felt the affection,
            I felt the spark and more importantly the love (the true definition of it in its most subtle and purest form), which was completely afresh for me. I had never felt anything like that for anyone. Your presence made me feel how much of an integral
            part can you become for me. I craved to talk to you, to be with you. With so many things going, I never wanted to speak up and say anything as I could never lose you. I just waited for you as I always knew you were too precious for a little
            man like me! And finally the day you confessed, it was<b>The Best Day of My Life</b>!<br><br>I feel the utter delight to begin the day with you, gives me enough trust that my day shall inevitably go good. In the afternoon when we take break
            and rest together after the tough schedule could not be any better or any more relaxing. Just your presence can wear off all my fatigue & exhaustion and fill me with this immense load of energy. And as the evening surpasses I wait for us to
            come together again at night which not just becomes the most precious part of the day but gives me the most soothing sleep taking away every bit of distress or tiredness. I might not say this out loud a lot of times but honestly this is the
            best schedule of my life by all means I want this to stay for all the years to come.<br><br>I know that I am not always the ideal one, I do know I might become annoying at times, I know that I have several flaws, but the fact that you have
            accepted me over and above all these flaws makes me feel extremely special. I feel like no one in this world, truly no one, can ever be as lucky, as happy, as successful, as complete as I am. <b>You Complete Me Jaan</b>! So what I can say
            is despite all these, you are the one with whom I see everything with, with whom I want to share not just moments but my life with.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>"I have faith in what I see,</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Now I know I have met an angel in person,</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>And
            she looks perfect,</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>I don't deserve this,</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>You look perfect tonight!"</b>
            <br><br>Its just that you look and you are perfect <b>Always</b>!<br><br><b>I love you always and forever</b>, and even in our gravest moment or in the happiest moment I shall be by your side holding your hand and waiting until the sun sets
            and the new morning light brings more love between us!
        </p>
        <p><b>Only yours,</b></p>
